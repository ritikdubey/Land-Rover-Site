  <h3 class="tagline">Above & Beyond</h3>
  <h2 class="history-head">Our Glorius Past</h2>
  <p class="history">This luxury British car manufacturer started as the Rover Company, which was established in 1885 producing bicycles in Warwickshire, England. After they moved into automobile production, the Land Rover came out as a model series
    under this company in 1948.
    First Land Rover was designed by chairman of the Rover Company Maurice Wilks in 1947.
    While staying on his family farm in Wales with his brother Spencer, Maurice Wilks worked on the Land Rover prototype.
    Land Rover colors were all in a muted green in the early years due to a surplus of military auto paint after World War II.
    The Land Rover model made its debut on April 30, 1948 at the Amsterdam Motor Show. In 2008, Indian-based Tata Motors acquires Land Rover and Jaguar from Ford, creating the Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary.
